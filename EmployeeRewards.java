// QN 2a - EmployeeRewards


/*
Short Explanation:
Problem: Distribute candies to employees based on their ratings while following these rules:
- Every employee must receive at least one candy.
- Employees with higher ratings than their neighbors should receive more candies.

Approach:
# Perform two scans through the ratings:
1. Left-to-Right: Increase candies if an employee has a higher rating than the one before.
2. Right-to-Left: Ensure employees with higher ratings than the next one still receive more candies.
# The total number of candies required is the sum from both passes.

Complexity:
- Time: O(n), where n is the number of employees.
- Space: O(n), for storing the candies for each employee.

        // Step 1: Initialize an array to store candies for each employee

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            candies[i] = 1; // Every employee starts with at least 1 candy
        }

        // Step 2: Left-to-right pass
        // Give more candies to employees with higher ratings than their left neighbor

            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) {
